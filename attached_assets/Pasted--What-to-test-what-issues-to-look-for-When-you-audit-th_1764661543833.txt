✅ What to test / what issues to look for
When you audit the site, check for the following common problems many ecommerce / product-upload sites have. valido.ai+3BrowserStack+3UXPin+3
Possible issues to test/check


Page load speed — Large/unoptimized images, heavy JS, or many elements can make pages slow. Slow loading is a major cause for users dropping off. BrowserStack+2Webstacks+2


Mobile / responsive design — The site must display and behave properly on phones/tablets (not just desktop). If the layout breaks or text/buttons are unreadable, many users will bounce. HubSpot Blog+2Wikipedia+2


Navigation / site structure — If menus/categories are confusing, missing, or poorly labelled, users may struggle to find products. A complex or unclear navigation is a common usability flaw. Nomensa+2Webstacks+2


Cluttered layout / inconsistent design — Too many fonts, colors, images, or design styles can look unprofessional and make the site hard to use/read. Inconsistent UI elements or design drift across pages harms user experience. UXPin+2Webstacks+2


Poor or too few product images / low image quality — When images are low resolution, not detailed, or there aren’t enough angles, users can’t properly evaluate products, hurting purchase confidence. Webstacks+2valido.ai+2


Insufficient product information/details — Missing specs, unclear descriptions, lack of size/material/feature info makes it hard for users to decide. Improves trust and reduces abandonment when details are clear. valido.ai+1


Weak call-to-action (CTA) placement or missing CTAs — Buttons like “Add to cart”, “Upload product”, “Checkout”, etc. must be visible, intuitively placed, and work properly. Bad CTA design lowers conversions. BrowserStack+2UXPin+2


Poor UX for product listing / catalog / product detail pages — For example: broken links, missing images, missing/incorrect product attributes, faulty pagination or filters, bad search functionality. Especially if the site aims to support many products — these aspects need careful testing. BrowserStack+2toptal.com+2


Lack of trust/compliance signals — Contact info, security (HTTPS), privacy, accessibility, alt-text for images: absence of these can reduce user trust. BrowserStack+2HubSpot Blog+2


So before anything else — you should test the site thoroughly: product upload flow, product detail pages, product image uploading & display, mobile vs desktop, speed, navigation, add-to-cart/checkout (if applicable), error handling (if upload fails etc), search/filter functionality, and overall UI/UX.

🚀 Advanced Features / Improvements You Should Consider (or Add)
If you want the website to become more professional, user-friendly and conversion-ready — here are enhancements / advanced features worth adding:


Better product image management


Allow multiple images per product (different angles, zoom, maybe 360° view or video) so users can clearly view product. valido.ai+1


Enable image optimization (compress images, responsive image sizes) so images load fast but still look good. Webstacks+1


Provide alt-text / descriptive text for images (for accessibility) and to aid SEO. HubSpot Blog+1




Improved layout & design consistency


Adopt a design system or style guide — consistent fonts, colors, UI elements so the site feels cohesive and professional. UXPin+1


Use clean, uncluttered layout with proper spacing/white-space to avoid overwhelming users. Nomensa+1




Enhanced navigation & search/filter features


If many products/categories: implement faceted filtering, sorting, maybe search bar to help users find products easily. toptal.com+1


Add breadcrumbs or clear category hierarchies so users know where they are and can navigate back. Webstacks+1




Better UX/Usability features


Use clear, prominent CTAs (upload, add to cart, checkout, contact). BrowserStack+1


Provide feedback / error handling — e.g. during product upload, if something goes wrong, show clear error messages; during checkout or form submission, show loading/spinner and confirmation. Lollypop+1


Offer searchability and discoverability, good metadata for products (title, description, specs), to let users find products easily. Wikipedia+1




Modern features to boost engagement/conversion


Live chat / chatbot support — so visitors can ask questions in real time. This helps especially if products need clarification or customers are uncertain. Northern Commerce Inc.+1


Personalization / recommendation engine — if you have many products, show related items, recently viewed, popular items, or suggestions based on user behavior to increase engagement. wsiworld.com+1


Review / Q&A / feedback system — let buyers leave reviews or ask questions about products, which helps build trust and clarity for other users. contentsquare.com+1




Accessibility & performance / security


Ensure site works well for mobile and desktop devices. Use responsive design or adaptive design approach. Wikipedia+1


Optimize for speed (compress images, use CDN, caching, minimize heavy scripts) so pages load quickly. Webstacks+1


Ensure security and trust signals (HTTPS, privacy info, contact info) — especially important if storing user data or doing transactions. BrowserStack+1





✅ How to Do a “Full Test / Audit” of the Website
Here’s a suggested checklist (test plan) you or a QA/UX person should run to evaluate the site thoroughly:
Test AreaWhat to checkPage Load & PerformanceLoad time for homepage, catalog pages, product-detail pages; image load times; responsiveness on slow networks/mobile.Responsiveness (Mobile/Tablet/Desktop)Layouts adapt properly; buttons/menu readable; no horizontal scroll; touch-friendly.Navigation & SearchMenu structure, category organization, search bar (if any), filters/sorting, breadcrumbs, ease of finding products.Product Upload / Listing (since you have upload feature)Upload flow works; uploaded images display correctly; metadata (title/description) get saved/displayed; no broken links; support for multiple images per product.Product Detail PageHigh-res images, multiple views, clear descriptions/specs, pricing, stock/availability, alt-text for images, correct layout, add-to-cart (if applicable) works.Usability & UI ConsistencyFonts/colors/buttons are consistent; layout uncluttered; CTAs visible and functioning; flow intuitive across pages.Error Handling & FeedbackIf user does something wrong (incorrect upload, missing fields), show clear errors; after successful action, show confirmation; handle broken links or missing resources gracefully.Accessibility & ComplianceAlt-text for images, color contrast, readable fonts, keyboard navigation (optional), legible text, no reliance solely on images/icons.Trust & Security ElementsHTTPS, visible contact info or about page, privacy info, transparent product info, any trust badges or disclaimers.Advanced UX Features (optional but recommended)Search/filter, live-chat/support widget, product recommendations, reviews/Q&A, personalization (if relevant), consistent design system, analytics/tracking for UX.

🧰 What Specifically I Think Needs Improvement in Your Site
Since I saw only the root page and not a fully functioning product catalog yet (maybe because you’re still developing), here’s what you likely need to focus on (if not already done):


Optimize images and media — if you allow product uploads, ensure images are compressed/resized properly and displayed in good resolution.


Implement mobile-first / responsive design so users on phone get smooth experience.


Build clear navigation and product listing layout — categories, filters/search, consistent UI, clean grid or list view for products.


Add product detail pages with good descriptions, images, proper layout, and product metadata.


Add upload flow validation & error handling — if uploading images/files, check that nothing breaks, invalid file types are rejected, user is given feedback.


Consider advanced features like live chat for support, review/feedback, product search/filter, and possibly recommendation or personalization if many products.



If you like — I can do a quick UX audit of the site live (based on what’s visible now) and produce a report containing all current issues + severity + recommended fixes — this will give you a concrete to-do list.
Do you want me to build that report for you now?
