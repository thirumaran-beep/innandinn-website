⭐ SUMMARY OF WHAT TO FIX (High-priority)

If any of these fail, they must be fixed immediately:

🔥 1. Missing server-side validation

Most apps only do client-side — dangerous and insecure.

🔥 2. Weak error handling

Blank page / no progress bar = BAD UX.

🔥 3. Security vulnerabilities in ZIP uploads

ZIP uploads are high-risk if not sanitized.

🔥 4. Mobile version broken

Many people upload from phone — must work.

🔥 5. No duplicate or corruption checks

Can lead to broken database entries.
