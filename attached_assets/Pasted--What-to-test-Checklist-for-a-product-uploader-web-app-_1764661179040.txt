✅ What to test — Checklist for a “product-uploader” web app

For a web app that lets users upload product data (zip files, product metadata, images, whatever), you should ensure all of the following categories are tested:

Functionality Testing

Upload flow: does the upload (zip or otherwise) actually succeed? Are all valid file-types accepted? Are invalid types rejected (with a clear error)?

Form/data validation: required fields must be enforced; blank or malformed data should be rejected. Client-side and server-side validation both.

Data persistence: after upload, are the products stored correctly (database or storage)? Data fields should match what user submitted. 
GeeksforGeeks
+1

Error handling: what happens if upload fails (network issue, corrupted file, duplicate product, large file too big)? The app should handle gracefully and provide clear error messages.

Link/navigation: any links or redirects after upload should work; ensure no broken links.

Usability / UX Testing

Ease of use: Is the interface intuitive? Can a reasonable user upload with minimal steps, without needing technical knowledge. 
GeeksforGeeks
+1

Clear instructions / labels: Upload buttons, file-type instructions, error messages should be clear and user friendly. 
BrowserStack
+1

Feedback to user: On upload (success or failure), show meaningful feedback (progress bar, success message, error message).

Accessibility: For wider audience — support keyboard navigation, screen readers, mobile as well as desktop, etc.

Compatibility Testing

Cross-browser: App should work reliably across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, maybe older versions) without layout or functionality break. 
GeeksforGeeks
+1

Device / screen-size: Should support mobile browsers, tablets, desktops. Layout shouldn’t break; upload should be manageable on small screens. 
Hostinger
+1

Network conditions: Works under different bandwidths (fast internet, slow, intermittent) — uploads should handle timeouts, retries, or provide feedback.

Performance Testing

Upload performance: Uploading large files or many products should not crash or hang; check server response time. 
Hostinger

Scalability / load: If many users upload at the same time — does the system hold up? Database/storage performance should stay stable. 
Hostinger
+1

Resource usage: Monitor server CPU, memory, disk I/O when large uploads / many uploads happen.

Security Testing

File upload security: uploaded files — ensure no malicious code execution. Reject disallowed file types; scan for threats; ensure safe storage.

Input sanitization: Prevent injection attacks (e.g. SQL injection, XSS) especially if product metadata can include text fields (names, descriptions). 
Guru Software
+1

Access control / authorization: Ensure only authorized users (if applicable) can upload — prevent unauthorized access to upload functionality.

Data protection: If sensitive data is involved, ensure data is transmitted/stored securely (HTTPS, encryption if needed).

Database / Data Integrity Testing

CRUD validation: After upload, can you read the data properly? Editing, deleting (if provided) should work.

Edge cases: Very large files, empty fields, special characters, very long strings — do they break storage or display?

Consistency: Data in the UI should match what's in the database/storage exactly. No mismatches.

🐞 What kinds of issues commonly show up (and what to watch for)

Based on that checklist, these are common issues you or testers might encounter in a product-uploader web app:

Upload works on fast internet but fails or times out on slow connection (no retry / no meaningful error).

File-type validation missing — users could upload unsupported or malicious files.

Form validation only on client side (bypassed by manual POST requests), causing invalid/malformed data in the backend database.

UI is confusing: instructions unclear, no feedback after upload, no progress indicator for large uploads — user thinks nothing happened.

Layout or functionality breaks on mobile or in non-standard browsers.

Under heavy load (many simultaneous uploads), server slows down or crashes, database locks or becomes inconsistent.

Security holes: e.g. missing sanitization leads to SQL injection or XSS through product descriptions.

Data mismatch between what user submits and what’s stored/displayed (wrong values, truncated fields, missing entries).

Inadequate error handling: generic “Something went wrong” instead of meaningful errors, making debugging and user experience poor.

🛠 What you need to do / fix or test to solve these issues

Here’s what you should do (or instruct your development/QA team) to make the app robust:

Write a comprehensive test suite covering functional, usability, compatibility, performance, security, and data-integrity tests. Use both manual and automated tests.

For uploads: enforce strict server-side validation of file type, size, and metadata; never trust only client-side checks.

Provide clear, user-friendly UI: instructions, feedback (progress bars, success/failure messages), and error explanations.

Test across multiple browsers & devices (desktop, mobile) under different network speeds.

Conduct load and stress testing, simulating multiple users or large files, to assess performance and scalability. Tools like load-testing software can help.

Perform security testing, including vulnerability scans (e.g. injection, XSS) and secure handling of uploaded files (e.g. store outside web-root, validate file contents).

Validate database integrity: after upload, test all CRUD operations, edge-case data, and ensure data matches what user submitted.

Establish logging and monitoring — to catch errors, failed uploads, security issues, resource bottlenecks in production.

🎯 My Quick Observations Based on the Link You Shared

I attempted to open the URL; I saw only a blank page (or header lines indicating the root URL), no visible obvious UI for upload. That itself is a red flag — maybe the app is not rendering properly (functional/UI bug) or you reached a page that needs additional context (login, parameters, etc.). You should check if the deployment or routing config is correct.

Because I cannot see upload controls or forms, you should verify that HTML/CSS/JS is working — maybe a missing build step, missing static assets, or console errors.

If this is a dev/staging environment, try testing with multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and also check browser console for JS errors or network errors.
