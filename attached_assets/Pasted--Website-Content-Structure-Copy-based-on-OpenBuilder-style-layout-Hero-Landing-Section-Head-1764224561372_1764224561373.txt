✅ What You Should Do Next

Since you already have product categories and company data, I recommend these steps to implement this template:

Build a simple home-page using above sections (hero, why us, what we offer, about, contact).

Create individual product/service pages (e.g. “Room Fresheners”, “Gas Cartridges”, “Mosquito Sprays”) using short, SEO-optimized content — each with its own title tag and meta description.

Add a “Blog/Resources” section — start with 3–5 articles addressing common customer questions or interests (safety, comparison, usage tips). This drives content volume + organic traffic.

Use clean URLs (e.g. /room-fresheners, /mosquito-sprays, /contact-us) so your site remains user-friendly and SEO-friendly.
